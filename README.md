This module will help to create a Azure Linux Virtual Machine with System assigned identity and it will aslo assign contributor role to the Virtual Machine. We are also running a shell script inside this Virtual machine using Custom_Data and base64encode function. We have added Network security Group to the Virtual machine , no network security group is attached to the subnet here but we can add in the similar manner. Hope this will help !
